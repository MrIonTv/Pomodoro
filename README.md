# Pomodoro Clock

This repository will have the project of my pomodoro clock in case someone wants to use it or edit it

To use this aplication you only need to know 4 little things
- Start Button will make the time run, only allowing you to increase or decrease the remaining sessions.
- Concetration Field: it increase or decrease between 10 and 90 minutes.
- Rest Field: it increase or decrease between 5 and 30 minutes.
- Sessions Field: you as user, can have between 1 and 99 sessions.
- Reset Button: is only a refresh for the page due to some bugs.

Explanation about sessions:
- The clock will give you an advise everytime you need to rest or start working again
- Each sessions is the sum of Concentration and Rest fields, the whole clock is these sessions multiplied by Sessions Field.
- If you want to change the time of any field when the session already started, you might refresh the page or use the Reset button for this action, since normaly you shouldnt change how much time you want to use.
